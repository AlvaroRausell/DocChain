__An attempt to make a blockchain-base medical database__

This project was developed for the Hackathon HEX. This project was made for one of the challenges available at the event: 
to develop a blockchain-based database that would store the information in a decentralised, secure manner, where the
patient would chose who to give access to. 

This repository only includes the back-end part of the project.
